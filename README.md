# ComputerScience
A repository to keep all of my intro to comp Sci projects

The purpose of the code in this repository is for me to keep track and organize all of my work for my 
introduction to computer science class.
This repository has two sections, Assignments and projects
Since it is an introductory course there are many different small programs that we write
to help the class learn the language.
This type of work is stored in the Assignments portion

We also have a few things that we have to make ourselves and tend to be a bit bigger/more extensive and written completely on 
our own. 
This type of work is stored in the Projects portion
